# An example for FHIR ConceptMap/$translate

This is a simple example of how to connect up UI Bootstrap's Typeahead control to the [ValueSet/$expand](http://hl7.org/fhir/conceptmap-operations.html#translate) operation.

This provides a simple way to find and select a code in one CodeSystem / ValueSet, and then use a ConceptMap to translate it.

Uses a public sandbox endpoint of [Ontoserver](https://ontoserver.csiro.au/).
