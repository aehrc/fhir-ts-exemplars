# An example for FHIR ConceptMap/$translate

An example of how to connect up UI Bootstrap's Typeahead control to the [ConceptMap/$translate](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/conceptmap-operation-translate.html) operation.

This provides a simple way to find and select a code in one CodeSystem / ValueSet, and then use a ConceptMap to translate it.

Uses a public sandbox [endpoint](https://r4.ontoserver.csiro.au/fhir/) of [Ontoserver](https://ontoserver.csiro.au/).
