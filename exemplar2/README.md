# Exemplar 2 - A uib-typeahead example for FHIR ValueSet/$expand

This is a simple example of how to connect up UI Bootstrap's Typeahead control to the [ValueSet/$expand](http://build.fhir.org/valueset-operations.html#expand) operation.

This provides a simple way to find and select a code from code systems like SNOMED CT subject to the criteria encoded in a ValueSet.

Uses a public sandbox endpoint of [Ontoserver](https://ontoserver.csiro.au/).
