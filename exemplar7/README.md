# Exemplar 7 - UI that ensures users have performed a relevant code search.

Example of how a UI can be designed to encourage capture of coded clinical data rather than free text.

In this example the user is required to perform a relevant search before being able to enter and record a free-text alternative.

Uses a public sandbox endpoint of [Ontoserver](https://ontoserver.csiro.au/).
